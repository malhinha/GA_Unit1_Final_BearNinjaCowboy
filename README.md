# Bear, Ninja, Cowboy!

### Background

**Bear, Ninja, Cowboy** is a game where the player competes against the computer in the _rock, paper, scissors..shoot!_ game play fashion.

The player will choose between playing a bear, a ninja or a cowboy. The computer will randomly do the same. The game rules are:
- Ninja beats Cowboy
- Cowboy beats Bear
- Bear beats Ninja

**Updates after chatting w Teo:**
The game will be executed in rounds. First to 5 points wins the round (1 point for a win, -1 point for each loss).

Second round, is until 10 points, with bonus for consecutive wins (& penalty for consecutive losses).

Stretch goal: Third rounds introduces new hero?
