# Bear, Ninja, Cowboy!

**Bear, Ninja, Cowboy** is a game where the player competes against the computer in the _rock, paper, scissors..shoot!_ game play fashion executed in head to head matches across multiple rounds/levels.

## Gameplay

The player will choose between playing a bear, a ninja or a cowboy. The computer will do the same. The game rules are:
- Ninja beats Cowboy
- Cowboy beats Bear
- Bear beats Ninja

At game start, the player will have the option to choose a difficulty level: **easy**, **medium**, **hard**, & **ya nuts?**. **Easy** will mean that the computer has a simple pattern that dictates her choices for each battle. **Medium**, the pattern will be longer; **Hard**, slightly longer. **Ya Nuts?**: a random logarithm will determine the computer's choice per each match.

### Game Rules

Each head to head battle would represent one match. The winner gets a point for a win. The loser loses a point. The game will be executed in rounds, i.e. levels:

Level 1: First to 5 points wins the level.
Level 2: First to 10 points wins the level.
Level 3: First to 15 points wins but with +1 bonus for 2 consecutive wins (& -1 penalty for 2 consecutive losses).
Level 4: Bonus increases to +2 for 3 consecutive wins (& -3 for 3 consecutive losses)
Level 5 & beyond: Same bonuses/penalties but computer choices start at random points in the index.
